-A, --show-all           equivalent to -vET
)

-E works like -e

-t works very strange. They make russian letters strange

-T does nothing for some reasons

-u I do not understand how works

-v does the same as -t, but -t should show the tabs, unfortunately it don't

This is a	test	file.
It contains	some	tabs.
Let's replace	them	with	^I.
